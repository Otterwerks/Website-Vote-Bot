# websitevotebot

This script loops through the process of opening a webpage with a radio button poll, selecting an option, and submitting a vote. I got the idea to make this script because I noticed that the poll refreshed and allows an option to be chosen and submitted again after reloading the page, I understand that submitting multiple votes does not necessarily mean that each vote is counted.
